RRSpreadSheet Component v0J4

This Folder contains the RRSpreadSheet framework, palette test application (all in the ./build directory), as well as source code
 for all three. In order to use the palette, you must drag the 
RRSpreadSheet.palette folder to /Developer/Palettes, and 
RRSpreadSheet.framework to a loction where  InterfaceBuilder can find 
it (/Library/Frameworks works well).

To distribute the framework with your application, you need only copy the 
framework to your application bundle's Framework directory.

The framework, palette and a test executable are defined as different
targets in the ProjectBuidler project file.

Cheers,
